Parameters:
d   Device name. For a list of supported devices use STK500.EXE -?
m   Select programming mode; serial (s), parallel/high-voltage (p),
    pdi (d) or tpi (t).
    Serial mode is the default mode if this parameter is ommitted.
ip  Name of ELF input file. Required for programming or verification
    of ALL memory types. The file format is AVR-8 bit ELF.
if  Name of FLASH or user signature input file. Required for programming or
    verification of the FLASH or user signature memory. The file format is
    Intel Extended HEX.
ie  Name of EEPROM input file. Required for programming or verification
    of the EEPROM memory. The file format is Intel Extended HEX.
of  Name of flash or user/production signature output file. Required for
    readout of the FLASH or user/production signature memory.
    The file format is Intel Extended HEX.
oe  Name of EEPROM output file. Required for readout of the EEPROM
    memory. The file format is Intel Extended HEX.
s   Read signature bytes.
O   Read oscillator callibration byte. 'address' is the address of the
    calibration byte as decribed in the data sheet of the device.
Sf  Write oscillator call. byte to FLASH memory. 'addr' is byte address
Se  Write oscillator call. byte to EEPROM memory. 'addr' is byte address
e   Erase device. If applied with another programming parameter, the
    device will be erased before any other programming takes place.
p   Program device; ALL memory types (a), FLASH (f), EEPROM (e), both (b) or
    user signature (u). Corresponding input files are required.
r   Read out device; FLASH (f), EEPROM (e), both (b), user signature (u) or
    production signature (p). Corresponding output files are required 
v   Verify device; ALL memory types (a), FLASH (f), EEPROM (e) or both (b).
    Can be used with -p or stand alone. Corresponding input files are required.
l   Set lock byte. 'value' is an 8-bit hex. value.
L   Verify lock byte. 'value' is an 8-bit hex. value to verify against.
y   Read back lock byte.
f   Set fuse bytes. 'value' is a 16-bit hex. value describing the
    settings for the upper and lower fuse.
E   Set extended fuse byte. 'value' is an 8-bit hex. value describing the
    extend fuse settings.
XE  Set xmega fuse bytes 4 and 5. 'value' is a 16-bit hex. value describing the
    settings for last 2 xmega fuses.
XV  Verify xmega fuse bytes 4 and 5. 'value' is a 16-bit hex value to verify
    against.
XU  Erase user signature. If applied with user signature programming parameter,
    the user signature will be erased before programming takes place.
F   Verify fuse bytes. 'value' is a 16-bit hex. value to verify against.
G   Verify extended fuse byte. 'value' is an 8-bit hex. value describing
    the extend fuse settings.
q   Read back fuse bytes.
af  FLASH address range. Specifies the address range of operations. The
    default is the entire FLASH. Addresses are byte oriented.
ae  EEPROM address range. Specifies the address range of operations.
    The default is the entire EEPROM. Byte addresses.
Y   Perform the oscillator calibration sequence. See appnote AVR053 for more
    information.
Z   Loads a value from an EEPROM location prior to chip erase which then
    can be programmed into FLASH or EEPROM using the S option. Address is
    a hex value. See appnote AVR053 for more information.
c   Select communication port; 'COM1' to 'COM8' for STK500 or AVRISP, 'USB'
    or 'USB:<sernum>' for AVRISP mkII. If this parameter is ommitted the
    program will scan the COM ports for STK500/AVRISP only.
ut  Set target voltage VTARGET in Volts. 'value' is a floating point
    value between 0.0 and 6.0, describing the new voltage.
ua  Set adjustable voltage AREF in Volts. 'value' is a floating point
    value between 0.0 and 6.0, describing the new voltage.
wt  Get current target voltage VTARGET.
wa  Get current adjustable voltage AREF.
Wt  Verify that VTARGET is within 5% of the given value. 'value' is a
    floating point value between 0.0 and 6.0.
b   Get revisions; hardware revision (h) and software revision (s).
!   Set oscillator frequency; 'freq' can be whole Hz, or kHz or MHz
t   Get oscillator frequency.
I   Set ISP frequency; 'freq' can be whole Hz, or kHz or MHz
J   Get ISP frequency.
g   Silent operation.
z   Not used. Supported for backwards compability.
h   Help information (overrides all other settings)
